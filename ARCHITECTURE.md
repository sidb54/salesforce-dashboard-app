# Salesforce Dashboard: Architecture and Challenges

## Overall Architecture

The Salesforce Dashboard is a full-stack web application with a clear separation between client and server components.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Secure Authentication System
- Implemented JWT token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Used HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens to prevent XSS attacks
- Applied proper password hashing (bcrypt) for secure storage
- Implemented token refresh mechanism for seamless user experience

### 2. Salesforce Integration
- Created a secure connection to Salesforce using OAuth 2.0
- Implemented server-side API to proxy Salesforce requests
- Added data pagination for handling large datasets efficiently
- Used React Query for optimized data fetching with caching

### 3. Type Safety Throughout
- Used TypeScript across both client and server
- Created proper interfaces for all data models
- Implemented validation schemas with Yup for form data

### 5. Data Management
- Implemented efficient data fetching with React Query
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Created a responsive data display with pagination

## System Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User registers or logs in
   - Server validates credentials, creates JWT access token and refresh token
   - Access token stored in memory, refresh token in HTTP-only cookie
   - Token refresh happens automatically when needed

2. **Salesforce Data Flow**:
   - Authenticated requests from client to server
   - Server validates JWT, then proxies request to Salesforce API
   - Data returned to client with appropriate pagination
   - Client caches data with React Query for performance

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Structure
- Express routes organized by domain (auth, salesforce)
- Controller layer handling business logic
- Middleware for authentication and request validation
- Sequelize models for user data
- Configuration management with environment variables

### Frontend Structure
- Component-based architecture with React
- Context providers for authentication state
- Custom hooks for data fetching and business logic
- Separation of pages and reusable components
- Form validation with Formik and Yup

## Challenges Faced

1. **Secure Authentication Implementation**:
   - Creating a secure refresh token mechanism that works across different clients
   - Balancing security with user experience

2. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**:
   - Setting up proper CORS configuration for secure communication
   - Handling HTTP-only cookies across domains

3. **Data Pagination and Performance**:
   - Implementing efficient server-side pagination
   - Optimizing client-side caching to reduce API calls
   - Balancing data freshness with performance

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt and proper salt rounds
- HTTPS enforced for all communications
- XSS protection through proper content security policies
- CSRF protection through tokens
- Input validation on both client and server sides
- Secure HTTP headers with Helmet.js

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more advanced data visualization components
- Expanding Salesforce API coverage to include more objects
- Implementing user roles and permissions
- Adding MFA
